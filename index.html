            <div id="tribute-content">
                <p><strong>1867</strong> - Born in Warsaw, Poland.</p>

                <p><strong>1893-94</strong> - Earned math and physics degrees at the Sorbonne in Paris. Started writing a doctoral thesis on radiation. It had been discovered in 1896 by Antoine Henri Becquerel.</p>
                <p><strong>1895</strong> - Married physicist Pierre Curie, head of the laboratory at the School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris. Joined him in his work there.</p>
                <p><strong>1896-1903</strong> - Measured radiation levels emitted by various compounds. Discovered two substances that emitted more radiation than would be expected. In 1898, concluded that one of them contained an unknown radioactive element. Pierre Curie joined his wife in conducting research. Together, the pair discovered two new radioactive elements. They named the elements polonium (after Poland) and radium. Their work then focused on identify their chemical properties.</p>
                <p><strong>1897</strong> - Gave birth to her first daughter, Irene.</p>
                <p><strong>1903</strong> - Earned her doctorate, based on the work described in her thesis, Radio-Active Substances. With her husband and Becquerel, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.</p>
                <p><strong>1904</strong> - Gave birth to her second daughter, Eve. Pierre Curie named a professor at the Sorbonne.</p>
                <p><strong>1906</strong> - After her husband was killed by a truck on a Paris street, assumed his position at the Sorbonne. Became the first female lecturer in the 750-year history of the university. Also assumed charge of the Sorbonne lab.
                </p>
                <p><strong>1908</strong> - Promoted to Professor at the Sorbonne.</p>

                <p> <strong>1911</strong> - Awarded a second Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for isolating pure radium.
                </p>
                <p><strong>1914-1918</strong> - During World War I, developed X-rays for use in medicine.
                </p>
                <p><strong>1918-1934</strong> - Became director of the scientific department of the Radium Institute. Joined by her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie and husband Frederic Joliot. Continued to research the chemistry of radioactive materials and their medical applications. Lectured internationally. Established scholarships for scientists.
                </p>
                <p><strong>1934</strong> - Died of leukemia, likely due to prolonged exposure to radiation during her lifetime.
